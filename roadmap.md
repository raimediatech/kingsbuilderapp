# KingsBuilder Development Roadmap

## 🚀 Current Status (December 2024)

### ✅ What's Working:
- **Basic Shopify App Structure**: App loads in Shopify admin
- **Page Management**: Create, edit, delete pages with in-memory storage
- **Template System**: 5 pre-built templates (Blank, About, Contact, FAQ, Landing)
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Mock analytics data with detailed metrics
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Professional Shopify-style interface
- **Black Theme**: Consistent black color scheme throughout
- **API Endpoints**: Full CRUD operations for pages and templates

### 🔧 Currently Fixing:
- **Button Functionality**: Fixing JavaScript event handlers
- **Modal System**: Ensuring proper modal display and interaction
- **Data Persistence**: Pages reset on server restart (Vercel limitation)

### ⚠️ Known Issues:
- **Memory Storage**: Data doesn't persist between deployments
- **No Authentication**: Single shared instance for all users
- **No Real Shopify Integration**: Not connected to actual Shopify pages
- **Limited Functionality**: Basic CRUD only, no drag-and-drop builder

### 🎯 Immediate Next Steps:
1. Fix all JavaScript functionality issues
2. Add persistent database storage
3. Implement proper Shopify OAuth
4. Add real page builder interface
